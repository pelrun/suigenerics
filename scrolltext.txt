.............................Helloooo Syntax! Thanks for putting on such a great party! It's great to see old friends again and meet new ones. Obligatory (but sincere) greetings to cTrix, Jimage, miknik, Greg, SqueakyNeb, endgame, cpdt, Alex, emil, Jazzcat, John, and everyone I haven't had a chance to talk to yet. I think this is probably the first time someone has written a demo for the Amstrad NC100. Apologies for the lack of sound, but even if I wrote some the speaker on this machine is broken anyway!!!!
